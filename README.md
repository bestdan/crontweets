# crontweets
An R library for managing and posting Twitter content on a schedule.

# Setup Guide
I've also created a [setup guide](Setup.md) for a scheduled tweet-bot library on AWS EC2.

What you'll use:  

- AWS EC2: for a constantly on computer running the schedule.  
- iTerm3: for ssh'ing into your EC2 instance.  
- git/github: for maintaining your code and library.  
- R: for accessing the library and interfacing with Twitter. Uses the twitteR package.
